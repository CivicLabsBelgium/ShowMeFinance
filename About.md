 

## Thereâ€™s something wrong with finance data  

- Increasing role of technology is making finance more and more global and intricate, while concentrating wealth and knowledge in a small portion of the population. 
- The complexity and remoteness of finance make it inaccessible for stakeholders in the current debates on questions such as ecology, human rights or sovereign debt.  
- This creates a knowledge gap between finance and the institutions representing the interest of the general public: governments, law courts or the press. This gap has the effect of fostering defiance towards political and judicial institutions, thus popularizing authoritarian regimes and threatening the Rule of Law. 
- On the side of finance, the same defiance results in the adoption of tax evading schemes relying of tax havens inside and outside Europe, reinforcing sovereign debt, income inequality and negative sentiment towards institutions. 

 
## How to fix it 

- Leveraging collaborative programming method and tools to pass actionable information to the general public in visual form and clear language. 
- Open sourcing information on trade markets to improve transparency and promote ethical finance. 
- Moving from competition to collaboration in market analysis to build up accountability and trust.
- Using free and open databases and API's to improve financial literacy and raise awareness on economical issues.
- Investigating toxic debt and vulture funds to address systemic risk and destructive financial practice.
