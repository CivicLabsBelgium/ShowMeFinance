This is an example of a mapping job with the OpenFIGI API (https://www.openfigi.com/api). 

The API allows to retreive metadata on financial products with POST requests taking various identification systems as arguments. 
Here, The ISIN number is used. 
The ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) is the most common identifier for financial products. 
The attribution of ISIN numbers is managed by Standard and Poor's.
Since 2018, the ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority) publishes the Systematic Internaliser calculations (SI lists): 
https://www.esma.europa.eu/data-systematic-internaliser-calculations 
The SI lists aim at publishing the volume and number of transactions of financial products over Europe. 

By mapping the SI lists with the OpenFIGI API, it is possible to obtain more detailed information on financial products. 
Following the initial goal to obtain information on the secondary market of sovereign bonds and investigate vulture funds, 
the focus is here on a sovereign bond from Italy.
Sovereign bonds are found in the Non-equity CSV files on the SI page. 

Posterior to the mapping job, the original CSV file from the SI list has been uploaded and cleaned in RStudio, 
this part will be my next commit.  

One row in the ESMA list “nonequity_si_calculations”, where one bond (ISIN) = one row:   

Calculation From Date: 1/1/2018
Calculation To Date: 6/30/2018
ISIN: IT0005137614
Total number of transactions executed in the EU: 9,895
Total turnover executed in the EU: 140,000,000,000.000


The Italian bond is the first of the list by transactions and turnover, note the period of calculation. 
This is from an early list where data was still incomplete. 

Mapping on the OpenFIGI API with RStudio: 

mapurl <- “https://api.openfigi.com/v2/mapping”

AAB <- POST(mapurl, body = '[{ "idType": "ID_ISIN", "idValue": "IT0005137614" }]', content_type_json())
content(AAB)

#result:
> IT0 <- content(AAB)
> str(IT0)
